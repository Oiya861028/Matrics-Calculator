# Matrics-Calculator
In math, there is a special 2D array called a matrix. With two matrix, you can perform many operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
This program will take the dimensions of two matrixes from the user. Next, the program will automatically fill the matrices with number ranging 1-99. The user will then enter a number to perform the following operation between these two matrices:
1 - Addition 
2 - Subtraction
3 - Multiplication
*** To perform Addition/Subtraction, you must have the same dimensions for both matrices ***
*** To perform Multiplication, the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column must be the same ***
